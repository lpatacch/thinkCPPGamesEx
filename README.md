# thinkCPPGamesEx
This project holds various different exercises people can do when learning from the <a href="https://github.com/lpatacch/thinkCPPGames/">thinkCPPGames</a> project/book. 

---
The Parson's problems are based on the code from the <a href="https://js-parsons.github.io/">js-parsons</a> project.</p>
		js-parsons was created by Ville Karavirta, Petri Ihantola, Juha Helminen, and Mike Hewner.
(The js-parsons project was modified to be able to support displaying C++ code.)
